## [2. medium/Add to Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/)
### [solution](https://github.com/Kospanulan/leetcode-solutions/blob/master/medium/2_add_two_numbers.py)

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.


## [5. medium/Longest Palindromic Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/)
### [solution](https://github.com/Kospanulan/leetcode-solutions/blob/master/medium/5_longest_palindromic_substring.py)

Given a string s, return the longest palindromic substring in s.


## [7. medium/Reverse Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/)
### [solution](https://github.com/Kospanulan/leetcode-solutions/blob/master/medium/7_reverse_integer.py)

Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.
